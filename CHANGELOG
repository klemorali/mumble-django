=======================
Mumble-Django changelog
=======================

Version 0.12, 29 Nov 2009:
------------------------------
* Added Player name validation to the registration.
* Changed syncdb to update existing instances as well.
* Added Support for pre-1.1.8 versions of Murmur's DBus interface (most notably,
  this is useful for Debian Lenny which ships with 1.1.4).
* Added account linking feature to allow users who registered through Mumble
  to associate their mumble-django Account with an existing Murmur account.
* Added ?version= tag to connect URLs.
* Added IP/Port validation: When creating a new server instance, Mumble-Django
  will try to bind to the specified address and port to see if they are available.
* Updated 1.2.0 slice to Murmur v1.2.0 beta1.
* Generally improved error handling and stability.

Version 0.11, 25 Sep 2009:
------------------------------
* Fixed wrong {% URL %} tag that caused the template to crash when an anonymous
  user joins.
* Added a FastCGI handler and example confs for Apache2 and Lighttpd.
* Updated registerUser and setRegistration for Murmur snapshot snapshot b58726.
* Added LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL to settings.
* Added checkenv command for manage.py, that runs a few basic tests on the setup.
* Added Polish translation.

Version 0.10, 1 Sep 2009:
------------------------------
* Added protected mode, which requires users to enter the server password
  for registration.
* Added getRegistration methods to the CTLs.
* Added autoconf command to the Munin plugin.
* Added user textures to the detail pages in the channel viewer.
* Added a user manager for server admins.
* Added reverse resolving of URLs, allowing MD to run in a shared VirtualHost.
* Added shell script to automatically generate a new SECRET_KEY.
* Fixed Python 2.4 incompatible syntax.

Version 0.9, 23 July 2009:
------------------------------
* Added i18n support, and translations to:
  - German
  - Croatian
  - Italian
  - Japanese
* Added more descriptive field names and help texts to the models.
* Added a rudimentary CLI.

Version 0.8, 11 July 2009:
------------------------------
* Added Ice connector objects. Now MD can connect via both DBus and Ice.
* Connectors can be used simultaneously, so managing 1.1.8 and 1.2.0 Murmurs
  is possible with a single instance of Mumble-Django.
* Full compatibility to Murmur 1.2.0.
* Added Channel descriptions to channel viewer for 1.2.0 servers.
* management.py can now *always* add servers with a non-default connstring,
  not only when the default connstring doesn't resolve.
* management.py tries to get connstring from an environment variable.
* Changed channel viewer to use <div>s instead of a table, which is a lot
  cleaner to generate.
* Fixed username@ missing in the channel links.
* Merged mmServer object directly into Model and cleaned up mmobjects.py.
* Added "Default connstring" and "Slice Version" fields to settings.py.
* Added a Munin plugin to display the number of players on each server.
* Added a few UNIQUE statements to the Models to prevent get() errors.

Version 0.7, 27 May 2009:
------------------------------
* Added copyright information about the Icons in the channel viewer to
  COPYRIGHT.
* Fixed bug that prevented various settings from being applied to Murmur.
* Fixed Python 2.4 incompatibility.
* Various minor bug fixes.
* Added setting users' textures.
* Added Mumble icon as favicon.
* Replaced YAML by a self-written template due to license problems.

Version 0.6, 02. May 2009:
------------------------------
* Re-Licensed the complete project under the GPL v2+, added License tags
  to code files.
* Added "default channel", "player name", "channel name", "IP obfuscation"
  settings to Mumble model, therefore now supporting every one of Murmur's
  config options.
* IMPORTANT: If updating from a version <= 0.5, please run:
    ./update-v0.5-v0.6.sh
  in the pyweb directory. That way, you will update the database without
  losing any data. If you are newly installing Mumble-Django, this does not
  apply.
* Various minor bug fixes.

Version 0.5, 18 April 2009:
------------------------------
* Added redirect for / into urls.py, as this is easier than configuring
  it in the Apache config because it doesn't require the user to do
  anything.
* Completely refurbished the user interface, now using a YAML template
  and ExtJS for some extra cool stuff. Still, the page does not _require_
  JavaScript to be enabled in order to function correctly, users with JS
  disabled will only see the registration forms and a hint to enable JS.

Version 0.4, 10 April 2009:
------------------------------
* Various bug fixes.
* Added settings for django-registration to settings.py, so users can
  actually find them and don't need to figure these out on their own.
* Added a form for Server Admins (people added to the Admin group on the
  root channel) to change a few settings like server password and MOTD.

Version 0.3, 25 March 2009:
------------------------------
* added basepath autodetection.
* added "Admin on root channel" field that allows editing the ACL of the
  root channel, to grant or revoke membership in the "admins" group,
  thereby granting/revoking Administrator privileges.

Version 0.2, 24 March 2009:
------------------------------
* Reorganized settings.py, so only one single line needs to be edited in
  order to configure everything.
* Added a syncdb hook that looks for already configured Murmur instances
  whenever syncdb is run, and writes found instances and users into the
  database.
* Various minor bug fixes.

Version 0.1, 21 February 2009:
------------------------------
* Set up a Django project that uses the Mumble application to make use
  easier for Django inexperienced users
* First official Release

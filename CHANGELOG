=======================
Mumble-Django changelog
=======================

Version 2.0beta1, 28 Feb 2010:
------------------------------
* Remove a lot of columns from MDs database and replace them with properties. That
  way, MD will be far more easily extendable in the future without requiring a
  database update; and it reduces redundancy.
  The database will be converted automatically, but keeping Backups is not a bad
  idea. :)
* Fix a few bugs that caused the default channel selector to break the creation of
  new server instances.
* Merge mumble-django-nat into the main branch.
* Add support for Murmur installations protected by an Ice secret.
* Add automatically fetching the slice using Murmur's getSlice method.
* Add getslice management command that checks if the slice can be fetched using
  Murmur's getSlice method.
* Add support for new configuration fields in Murmur.
* Adapt to the new texture handling introduced in Murmur 1.2.2.
* Add kicking users.
* Various minor bug fixes.

Version 1.5, 15 Feb 2010:
------------------------------
* Add a few checks for common problems in the Slice path, like spaces or the file
  name not ending with `.ice', to prevent nonsense Exceptions from Ice.
* Change the Ice CTL to only load the slice when there is no "Murmur" module.
* Replace SECRET_KEY variable with code to automatically generate it and store it
  in .secret.txt.
* Fix a bug in the Munin plugin that caused Munin to only graph the alphabetically
  first server instance.
* Display the aclAdmin property in the Admin instead of using isAdmin, to display
  changes in the ACLs directly.
* Change the CTL mechanism to be completely independent from MD, thereby making it
  easily reusable.
* Add view to feed Antiarc's AJAX channel viewer with data. See here for more details:
  http://github.com/cheald/murmur-manager/tree/master/widget/
* Add a script that provides a CLI for the CTL objects, allowing to change Murmur's
  configuration directly from the shell.
* Change the `default channel' field to a DropDown list.

Version 1.4, 9 Feb 2010:
------------------------------
* Remove automatic Murmur version detection, as it isn't possible with Ice.
  http://www.zeroc.com/forums/help-center/4781-multiple-connections-different-server-versions.html
* Remove packaged slices for Murmur, due to the massive overhead the packaging
  creates compared to the little gain - whether people need to configure the slice
  version or path doesn't really matter anyway.
* Enhance checkenv command to check:
  - for the root directory's permissions.
  - if the slice file is configured and readable.
* Remove getslice command which is now unnecessary.

Version 1.3, 7 Feb 2010:
------------------------------
* Added getslice command that downloads the current HEAD slice version from
  Mumble's Git repository.
* Added slice for 1.2.2 and updated settings.SLICE_VERSION accordingly.

Version 1.2, 31 Jan 2010:
------------------------------
* Cleaned up the code a lot.
* Don't link to non-booted server instances to prevent the user from getting an
  exception message.

* Added account linking feature to allow users who registered through Mumble
  to associate their mumble-django Account with an existing Murmur account.

Version 0.11, 25 Sep 2009:

  for registration.

------------------------------
* Added i18n support, and translations to:
  - German
  - Croatian
  - Italian
  - Japanese
* Added more descriptive field names and help texts to the models.
* Added a rudimentary CLI.

Version 0.8, 11 July 2009:
------------------------------
* Added Ice connector objects. Now MD can connect via both DBus and Ice.
* Connectors can be used simultaneously, so managing 1.1.8 and 1.2.0 Murmurs
  is possible with a single instance of Mumble-Django.
* Full compatibility to Murmur 1.2.0.
* Added Channel descriptions to channel viewer for 1.2.0 servers.
* management.py can now *always* add servers with a non-default connstring,
  not only when the default connstring doesn't resolve.
* management.py tries to get connstring from an environment variable.
* Changed channel viewer to use <div>s instead of a table, which is a lot
  cleaner to generate.

  COPYRIGHT.

* Fixed Python 2.4 incompatibility.
* Various minor bug fixes.
* Added setting users' textures.

* Replaced YAML by a self-written template due to license problems.

Version 0.6, 02. May 2009:
------------------------------
* Re-Licensed the complete project under the GPL v2+, added License tags
  to code files.
* Added "default channel", "player name", "channel name", "IP obfuscation"
  settings to Mumble model, therefore now supporting every one of Murmur's
  config options.
* IMPORTANT: If updating from a version <= 0.5, please run:
    ./update-v0.5-v0.6.sh
  in the pyweb directory. That way, you will update the database without
  losing any data. If you are newly installing Mumble-Django, this does not
  apply.
* Various minor bug fixes.

Version 0.5, 18 April 2009:
------------------------------
* Added redirect for / into urls.py, as this is easier than configuring
  it in the Apache config because it doesn't require the user to do
  anything.
* Completely refurbished the user interface, now using a YAML template
  and ExtJS for some extra cool stuff. Still, the page does not _require_
  JavaScript to be enabled in order to function correctly, users with JS
  disabled will only see the registration forms and a hint to enable JS.

Version 0.4, 10 April 2009:
------------------------------
* Various bug fixes.
* Added settings for django-registration to settings.py, so users can
  actually find them and don't need to figure these out on their own.
* Added a form for Server Admins (people added to the Admin group on the
  root channel) to change a few settings like server password and MOTD.

Version 0.3, 25 March 2009:
------------------------------
* added basepath autodetection.
* added "Admin on root channel" field that allows editing the ACL of the
  root channel, to grant or revoke membership in the "admins" group,
  thereby granting/revoking Administrator privileges.

Version 0.2, 24 March 2009:
------------------------------
* Reorganized settings.py, so only one single line needs to be edited in
  order to configure everything.
* Added a syncdb hook that looks for already configured Murmur instances
  whenever syncdb is run, and writes found instances and users into the
  database.
* Various minor bug fixes.

Version 0.1, 21 February 2009:
------------------------------
* Set up a Django project that uses the Mumble application to make use
  easier for Django inexperienced users
* First official Release

Thank you for downloading mumble-django. :-)

To install mumble-django, extract it to wherever you would like it to
reside, and then run:

    python manage.py syncdb

This script will create the database for you. You will be asked whether to
use Ice or DBus to connect to Murmur, so please make sure that:
a) Murmur is reachable either over Ice or DBus. How to configure that is
   described in the wiki at
   http://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/mumble-django/wiki/Connecting_Murmur_to_ICE
   and
   http://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/mumble-django/wiki/Connecting_Murmur_to_DBus
b) the slice version configured in settings.py matches the Murmur version
   you are running (1.1.8 or 1.2.0).
In case of an emergency, you can always skip this step and repeat it later
simply by running the syncdb command again.

If you need instructions on how to configure your web server in order to
serve this application, you can have a look at the Wiki at
<http://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/mumble-django/wiki/Webserver_Setup>. The wsgi
script is also able to detect the installation paths automatically, so you
shouldn't need to edit it.

Django_Registration requires a valid EMail address to be set in settings.py,
that can be used as a sender address for the registration emails. If you
intend to use the registration feature, you will need to change the
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL setting in settings.py.

Note that there it is discouraged to use the same Database that Murmur itself
uses, as mumble-django exclusively uses DBus to connect to Murmur and does not
access Murmur's database directly.

Also note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.0 or newer. You can obtain Python
from http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.

In order to use the Munin plugin that ships with Mumble-Django, just symlink
munin.py to /etc/munin/plugins and restart munin-node. Munin will then create
a new section called "Mumble users" in the Network category. Don't worry if
the numbers show up as "nan" at first, this will go away after a few Munin
runs. To test the plugin, simply run it:
    standalone: python munin.py
    via Munin:  munin-run <whatever you named the symlink in plugins>
It should give you an output like "1.value 10". If it doesn't, you might need
to set the MUMBLE_DJANGO_ROOT variable to the path you extracted Mumble-Django
to (i.e, the one mumble-django.wsgi can be found in).
